Regular Tasks:
download dataset
- read how to build the keras classifier
- read about cnn classifier
- read about keras and tensorflow
- Explore Keras website
- Study Model architechture.
- Read about layers convolution, maxpooling, dropout



Get dataset
- rt download Mnist dataset
- rt add it to project
- ct split mnist into training dataset and test dataset
- rt dimensions of the dataset and 3d RGB channels

Prepare the data
- ct set input shape as 28 by 28 pixels and RGB blackn white scaler as 1
- ct split data between x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test
- ct scale images to the [0,1] range
- rt Why convert x_train x_test to float 32?
- rt why divide by 255?
- ct images should have shape (28, 28, 1)
- ct/rt convert class vectors to binary classes

Build the model

- ct build the keras classifier model
- ct create a pipeline to pass images into the model
- ct build conv2D layer, Maxpooling2D layer, flatten, dropout 
- rt read kernel size, pool size, filters, strides, padding, num classes
- ct build dense layer



Train model

- ct define batch sizes
- ct set epochs
- ct compile model
- ct fit model

Evaluate model
- ct find accuracy and loss



QUESTIONS
- why do we divide dataset by 255 to normalize?
- Not clear about the process of normalzing pixel values?(need some guidance)
- How to choose the parameters that I need to set for the layers?
